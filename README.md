This branch is the future of alienware-kbl, I'm currently trying to:

+ Simplify & organize the code
+ Remove redundant code
+ Add comments
+ Respect the PEP8

+ The `block testing window` will be separated from the GUI.
+ The GUI will no longer use the root account.
    * The Daemon will be mandatory for using the GUI
    * gksu will be removed as dependence

The branch is currently un-stable and should not be used.
